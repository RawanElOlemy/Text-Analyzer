  o Calculate word frequency and display the most frequently used words.
  o Measure text readability, such as average sentence length.

4. Output:
  o Display results as you want.

6. Code Requirements:
  o Use F# sequences and pattern matching to parse text.
  o Use F# libraries like System.IO for file handling.
